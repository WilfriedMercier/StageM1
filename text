NAME\n    PROFCL
DESCRIPTION\n    Find best cluster parameters by BLE. No option is mandatory. Input file must be located in the same directory in order for the program to load default values.
                 Every option in input file can be changed by typing the desired option and value from the list below.

DATA TYPE\n    Information concerning OPTION for -D, --datatype argument. Default data are Mamon Mocks:
    Artis Mocks
             OPTION must be a string of the type 'A N1 N2 N3 N4' with N1 cluster richness, N2 cluster ellipticity, N3 cluster PA and N4 background (galaxies/arcmin^2). Default values are 160, 0.5, 50, 1.
    Mamon Mocks
             OPTION must be a string of the type 'M N1 N2 N3 N4 N5 N6 N7' with N1 cluster richness, N2 cluster ellipticity, N3 cluster PA, N4 background (galaxies/arcmin^2), 
             N5 logarithm of scale radius, N6 cluster center RA and N7 cluster center Dec. Default values are 160, 0.5, 50, 1, -2.08, 0, 0.
    AMICO data
             OPTION must be a string of the type 'd [N1-N2][N3-N4]', each list corresponding to a range of desired clusters indices. An unlimited amount of lists can be provided. 
             If no list is given PROFCL will skip detection and association files generation and will directly import data from detection and association files from previous build.
.FITS FILE CREATION
    For AMICO data, in order to speed up calculations, if -S option is trigered the selected halo, cluster and galaxies data will be saved in 3 seperate files, namely: detection_file, halo association
    file and cluster association file.
    
    Detection file
             This file contains selected clusters data and links clusters IDs with their corresponding halos IDs. If a cluster is linked to more than one halo, the closest halo is chosen. Some information
             on linked halos are also provided. The following information are given: 
             - cluster ID (ID)\t\t\t - cluster RA and Dec (RA, Dec)\t\t\t - cluster photometric redshift and error (z, z_err)\t\t\t - Signal/Noise ratio (SNR)\t\t\t - cluster richness (richness)
             - halo ID (halo_ID)\t\t\t - distance of cluster center from halo center (DIST)\t\t\t - halo mass (H_MASS)\t\t\t - halo "virial" radius (H_R200)\t\t\t - number of galaxies within halo (H_NGALS)
    Halo association file
             This file lists all the galaxies belonging to halos linked to selected clusters. Halo IDS are given as well as galaxies RA and Dec. Information on whether galaxies are central are not is given (1
             if central, 0 if not)
    Cluster association file
             This file links all galaxies belong to selcted clusters to their respective cluster. Clusters and galaxies IDs are give, as well as galaxies RA, Dec and probabilities of membership.
